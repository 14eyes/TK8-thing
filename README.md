Simple repo to keep some messy code and scripts used to generate some data about Tekken 8

Data is kept in the complete_JSONS folder
The lua script is used in cheat engine to extract the json to a file on disk. You should probably edit this to change the directory if you are using this.
Note that due to memory being overwritten less than hald of the files generated this way are usable. You want to look for files with filesize greater than 720KB.
Each json contains 999 games.

the python notebook is simply used to do some basic analysis and generate charts
